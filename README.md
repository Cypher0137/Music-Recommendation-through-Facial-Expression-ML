# Music-Recommendation-through-Facial-Expression-ML
Developed a music recommendation system that uses facial expression
recognition technology to recommend music based on the user's
emotional state. Utilized machine learning algorithms to analyze facial
expressions and map them to a corresponding emotional state.
Integrated the system with a music streaming service to recommend
songs or playlists that match the user's mood.
